You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.
How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.
Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.
Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.
Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!
I didn't. I did.
Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.
You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.
Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.
Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!
Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other...
Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?
We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.
Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.
Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.
Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.
What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.
Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up.
Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
What the fuck? You can turn into ice?
Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.
Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.
That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.
Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.
Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or…?
I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.
Oh, yeah.
Good luck, Mr. President.
Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.
I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!
You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
Ahhhh, shit!
A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.
Yes.
Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.
Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!
Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.
No idea what you're talking about.
Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?
Oldest Rick trick in the book.
Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.
So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.
W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?
All right, Morty you've done it!
All right, Morty, time to make our move.
Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.
Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.
Nooooo!
That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences.
Come on, here we go!
Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty
Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!
You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!
It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.
You're overreacting!
Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?
Why does he have to go over there?
A sequel.
What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.
Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.
Flip the pickle over.
let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii.
Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.
Good question. I suppose the answer is
Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!
Oh, God, moisture.
Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.
Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.
Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.
All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?
Ah, who cares?
So I wouldn't have to come here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!
We “isn't”
Yeah, well, tough titties.
I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!
All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?
Pickle Riiick!
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat.
Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?
Oh, here we go!
You should know that isn't original.
Shhh, Morty!
Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever...
No it doesn't. It hurts.
What? Why not?
Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.
Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.
- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -
...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game.
Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.
All right, buy now, I've been pretty clear that I thunk the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.
Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.
You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.
Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.
That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.
You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.
Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!
Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?
No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.
It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
Yes!
Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?
