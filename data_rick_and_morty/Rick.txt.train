That's Jan-Michaels.
Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!
Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.
Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die.
Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.
Yeah, not with that attitude.
Say it with me!
You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
Nope, they cannot.
Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying "Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."
Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.
Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez.
Oh shit.
A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.
Oh, crap, that sun is bright.
That'd be a lucky break for you.
Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!
That's a three-pointer!
What do you know, Morty? What do you know?
I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.
Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later.
Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...
Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.
Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!
My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.
Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.
I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.
Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!
Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.
Yeah, either one. Either one.
Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!
You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.
Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.
Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!
What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.
Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.
The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?
Congrats! You did it-- it!
HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!
All right, let's go.
I could--It could be Morty.
Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!
The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.
Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.
It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!
We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.
That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-
Nope.
Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.
You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.
Fine I'll just do it myself.
Morty.
What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?
Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.
Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.
And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
Morty!
Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.
Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.
Oh, come on!
That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
Just stay away from the coffee machine.
Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.
Huh, what do you know, it's working
Ugh, unless she has the flu.
Can't argue with that.
Summer, Morty, take off your collars!
Wow. Ugh.
Ugh! Oh, Christ...
Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before
W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?
Take cover, Morty!
The little girl!
I'm a full season behind.
Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.
No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.
You should know those men killed themselves.
Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...
Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time today
We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.
Barely.
I say…  Let’s do it!
Huh, so you're a liar.
Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.
Get that parkour. Get that parkour!
Shoney's.
Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?
Not an issue, sweetie.
Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.
Morty!
20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.
You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.
- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -
Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.
It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.
Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.
Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?
What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
I never will, baby.
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.
Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?
Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.
Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.
Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.
I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.
Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.
Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.
There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!
You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.
Hey, I can't help if I can't see.
O-kayyy...
Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?
Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!
Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.
Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!
Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!
Yeah, I feel safer already.
Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?
Congrats, you did it!
Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!
I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.
That's a three-pointer!
You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.
Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!
Fine, but I'm driving.
As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.
On my work bench, Morty.
Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.
Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.
Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.
- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -
Morty let's-let's see what else is on.
Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?
I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.
I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.
Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.
Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails.  Yeah yeah, I heard this one.  You get the idea  we're cool now.
The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!
When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.
Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.
There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.
Ahem.  Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.
There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.
We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.
I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!
Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
Morty, how many of these...?
Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?
Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?
I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.
Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?
Come on. That's it.
Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.
Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.
Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.
Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!
Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense.
That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.
This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.Morty 1
Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.
Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?
Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.
Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.
Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?
I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.
It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.
Snuffles, shake.
Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both  all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!
Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.
Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
Jaguar!
I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
And so that's the surprise, Morty.
Roll over.
You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?
What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?
It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.
Every day.
True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.
To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Me!
You don’t have to be a dick.
Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?
...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.
All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—
No, you're right. Where's the vodka?
I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.
It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.
Uh, my God, that's better.
Jaguar couldn't make it.
Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.
Mm-hmm.
Takes one to know one.
Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.
Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.
The point is he thought I was going to.
Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.
Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.
' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?
Duh!
Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?
Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.
Oh! Oh!
Okay. All right, all right.
God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.
Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—
Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit.
Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!
Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!
Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.
Uh, is this not a good time or...?
Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.
All right, Ruffles What's his name?
Eh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.
Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”.
Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?
Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.
Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.
Shit.
Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.
My balls.
The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.
Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.
Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.
Don't judge, Morty.
Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.
Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.
Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.
Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?
Oof! Didn't see that comin'.
Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.
I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...
Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.
Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.
Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.
What the hell is wrong with you two!? I—I m—I m—I mean you four!?
Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.
This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.
I think planet Earth has just been transported.
All right!
It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never "find a way" to "get out of" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes.
Titty-Bean?
When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.
Calling myself. Here, listen,  it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.
Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.
You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?
Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.
...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, "Oh, the Vindicators are so cool." I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob.
Guess who dismantled the government?
I want that "Mulan" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.
Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack.
Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.
Ah, God, gross and weird!
Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.
Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?
Uh-huh.
That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.
I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.
Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.
Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.
Go to the bathroom.
"And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?
Hey, Mooorty!
Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!
You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.
Ugh.
Yes, we're back, problem solved.
I don't think so. See you soon.
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.
You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?
Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.
Get off of me, Morty!
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.
Oh, shit.
Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here.
That's a three-pointer!
Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.
Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.
Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.
Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.
Me. I used to wear blue pants.
Uh oh.
Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.
It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.
I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.
They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!
For 97 more years, Morty!
Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.
No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.
So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?
I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.
It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.
Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.
Time to go another dream deep, Morty!
That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.
Did he say he never forgets a kid?
Don't fall for it, it's a bit.
Where are you guys going?
Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!
Yeah.
Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.
Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?
I got a surprise for you, Morty.
Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...
Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.
Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.
Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you.
They didn't  let me out.
It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.
Congrats, you did it!
Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.
Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwifty
Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!
No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.
Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.
Destroying the  galactic government.
Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.
Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.
Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.
I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!
Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.
Oh, for fuck’s sake.
Absolutely.
“Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.
And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.
Shut up, Summer.
Don't think about it!
They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.
Morty?
Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.
Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.
If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  "Sawwww".
What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
God damn it, I love myself.
Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.
Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.
Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.
You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty.
I dabble, Mr. President.
Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.
Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?
Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!
Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!
Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.
- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that "Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -
Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here
Relaxed enough?
You'll never get away with this, Concerto.
I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.
Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?
What new-  what new machine?
W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?
- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.
Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet.
