Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.
Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film "Mulan," where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.
Uh-oh! Spoilers!
Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God.
If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know...
And away we go!
Where the fuck is the lead wire?!
Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty.
Alright, perfect. Sit still,  arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.
Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!
It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.
By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special.
Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.
Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.
There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.
Genius happens in the moment, Morty.
Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers.
Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?
Run, Morty! Run!
Hey, Morty! Could you lick my…
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?
It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?
What part of "blackout" don't you understand? I thought you drank?
Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got.
Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.
Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.
I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.
Come get this delicious brine.
It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.
Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?
Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.
The Vindicators say their job is is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.
I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.
Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?
Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.
And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.
Got some of that mermaid puss!
What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!
He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.
Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.
Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.
Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.
I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -
Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.
I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!
For everybody.
That's a three-pointer!
What are you, stupid? We’re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, that’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.
Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!
So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?
Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.
