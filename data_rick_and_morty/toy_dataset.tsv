What, Rick? What’s going on?	Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.
It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?	I got a surprise for you, Morty.
Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!	Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up.
Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?	We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.
What?! A bomb?!	What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.
T-t-that's absolutely crazy!	Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.
Jessica? From my math class?	We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.
Ohh...	Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
Whhhh-wha?	When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.
No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!	And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
What are you talking about, Rick?	And so that's the surprise, Morty.
I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—	I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.
That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.	You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty.
I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!	You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
Oh, thank god.	Get off of me, Morty!
It was?	Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty.
Um...	Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.	We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.
Jessica.	You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
Jessica.	Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—
Whoa! Hi, Jessica.	What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?
Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!	Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.
Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.	Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.
Rename them?	There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.
Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.	It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.
Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.	Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!
Ah, Jessica.	I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.
Jessica.	There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.
Je-Jessica. Jessica.	It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.
Uh, morning, Frank.	All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—
Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.	HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?	I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!
I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.	Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?	Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.
Oh, geez, okay.	Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?
Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?	You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.	That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.
All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?	You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.
Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.	Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.
The mega trees?	You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!
All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?	Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.
AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!	Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!	Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.
Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.	Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?
Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!	Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.
Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.	There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.
Sure thing, Rick.	It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.	There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.
What?!	When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?	Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.
Uh-oh.	Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty
In my butt?	And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.
Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.	Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.
Uuuh.	I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?
In my butt?	That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-
Oh, man.	Why does he have to go over there?
Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.	What new-  what new machine?
Aaaaaah!	Run, Morty! Run!
Ohhhhh!	Don't think about it!
Ohhhhhh!	Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.
Aaaaah!	I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.
Whoooooo!	They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!
Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.	It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!
They're not robots, Rick!	Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!
Holy crap! This is insane!	You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.
Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding.	Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?
Yeah.	You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.	Takes one to know one.
I do?	What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.	A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.
Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.	What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
1.77245385... Whoa!	I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart!	Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.
Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.	The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!
Aw, man.	Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh.	I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
What's wrong?	Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.
Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.	No idea what you're talking about.
Aw, man!	Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.
Snuffles.	Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.
That was fantastic, Rick!	I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.
W-w-w-what is it?	Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.
You talking about "Inception"?	I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.
"Inception" made sense.	Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?	All right, Ruffles What's his name?
Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.	Snuffles, shake.
Ooohhh!	Roll over.
What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!	Go to the bathroom.
Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!	Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!	Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!	It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.	That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.
Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.	You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.
Ooh, oh! Oh, man.	Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.
I'm sorry. No, no.	Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.
No, thanks!	Uh-oh! Spoilers!
No, I'm okay.	I'm a full season behind.
Whoa!	It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.
Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!	All right, Morty, time to make our move.
It's Summer! Aw, geez.	Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.	Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!
Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!	Take cover, Morty!
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!	Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.
Huh?	Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.	Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!
Ohhhh!	Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math?	Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.
Ooooooaaahhh!	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!	Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!
But that's the opposite of what-	Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!
Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.	All right, let's go.
Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.	Don't judge, Morty.
Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.	Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.
Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.	Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.
You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.	Time to go another dream deep, Morty!
What the hell?	Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?
Oh, man, what's going on?	Oh, here we go!
- Dad! - Rick!	Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
Th-thanks, snuffles.	Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!
Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!	The little girl!
What?	Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
But I-it's been like a whole year!	Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!
Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.	What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
Aw, man, geez! Seriously?	Oh, yeah.
Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?	Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.
What?!	Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?
I'm gonna miss you, snowball.	Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.	Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.
You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.	Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.
Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.	Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.
Ugghh	Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
Ummm	Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?
Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.	You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.
You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!	You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.
Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.	As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.
Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.	Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?
Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?	Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?	Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.
Oh well, okay...	If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
Oww!	It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?
Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?	Ooh, great plan, Jerry.
Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!	No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.
WOW, thanks!	It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.
Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!	It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.
Oh, well, no problem Brad.	No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.
Whoa, take it easy!	Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.
Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?	Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!	It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.
It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!	I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.
What? What kind of monster are you?	What do you know, Morty? What do you know?
Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?	Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.
Wait a minute, what?	I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.
Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?	Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.
W-We just missed you a lot.	Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.
Oh!	Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
Phew...	Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.
Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-	Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.
Nuh uh!	You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?
Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.	It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.
You shut up you big... female asshole!	A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.
You didn't what?	Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?
What's yours?	Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.
You shut up!	Ugh, unless she has the flu.
Oh man... I don't feel good.	Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
Wait, who said that?	Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.
But I thought there were infinite timelines.	It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.
Oh, my God!	And away we go!
Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!	Shhh, Morty!
Rick what the hell are you doing?	Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.
Whoa whoa!	Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.
Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?	Uh oh.
Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.	Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.
I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.	Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.	Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.
W-what're you doing?	Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?
If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?	Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
You know, geez Rick, y—y—you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.	Huh, what do you know, it's working
Oh way to go, Rick.	Oh shit.
Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.	Yes, we're back, problem solved.
Why are you doing this?	How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.
Yes, oh, yes, yes!	I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!
Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.	What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?
Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.	Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.
I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.	Ah, God, gross and weird!
But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.	Summer, Morty, take off your collars!
Doesn't feel so good, does it?	Good question. I suppose the answer is
Uhh, where?	You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.
Hey.	Yeah.
Rick, are you really a musician?	Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.
Me!	No it doesn't. It hurts.
B-b-but we don’t have a song!	Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.
Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!	Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?
Oh man, ok, all right, um…	Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.
Like we’re not already under enough pressure!	Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.
Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!	The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.
Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?	Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
What?!	Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!
Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!	My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.
Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick!	I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.
What?!	No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.
That’s it!	You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!	Good luck, Mr. President.
I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.	I dabble, Mr. President.
Ahhh, shit.	Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?
Birdperson?	Yeah, not with that attitude.
But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?	All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?
All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?	Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!
Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does.	Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwifty
What’s that? Who’s that baby?	Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops
Oh God! We’re up?!?!	Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here
Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!	Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time today
Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!	I think planet Earth has just been transported.
Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?	Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.
Uhhh, I’m not sure?	Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.
Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!	Genius happens in the moment, Morty.
What do you say, Rick?	That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.
Ohhhh yeahhhh!	Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?
Ohhhh yeahhhh!	Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.
Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?	Hey, Morty! Could you lick my…
Understood.	Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!
Woahh!	Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!
Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?	Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.
Okay.	Nooooo!
Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!	Ahhhh, shit!
Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?	Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.
Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?	Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?
Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.	Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.
Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.	What? Why not?
I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.	What the fuck? You can turn into ice?
Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?	Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.
Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.	Ahem.  Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.
Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.	Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.
He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!	Morty!
What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!	I say…  Let’s do it!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!	All right!
Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.	Come on, here we go!
And how are you gonna do that?	Say it with me!
Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-	Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.
That's my sister. This used to be my home.	Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!
These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "I told ya so." So, uh--	ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.
What are you doing with that?!	I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.
No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!	You're overreacting!
Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.	Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.
Summer.	What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.	Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.
Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.	A sequel.
How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.	Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.
What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.	You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.
Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!	Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?
Rick!	Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?
R-Rick?	Morty let's-let's see what else is on.
That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!	Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?
I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!	Just stay away from the coffee machine.
Who's stupid now, bitch?!	Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.
Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.	Nope.
So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?	That's Jan-Michaels.
Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?	All right, Morty you've done it!
Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --	Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.
Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.	Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?
Oh, geez.	Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.
Oh, fuck.	Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.
Oh, man.	Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?
Oh, man.	Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.
You're gonna deny it.	Shoney's.
Oh.	Relaxed enough?
What are you talking about?	Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?
Szechuan?	' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?
McNuggets?	Yeah, well, tough titties.
What the hell?	Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.
What are you talking about, Rick?	The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
What are you talking about?!	Fine, but I'm driving.
What is that?!	To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
What are you talking about?!	Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film "Mulan," where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.
Rick?	Okay. All right, all right.
Rick?	Me. I used to wear blue pants.
Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?	I didn't. I did.
Rick? W-where are you?	Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?	Nope, they cannot.
What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.	Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.
And?	True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.
Was it?	Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.
Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?	Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.
Well, can you move? Can you fly?	Duh!
All right, well, do pickles live forever or --	Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.
I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.	What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?	I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.
Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?	20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.
Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?	Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.
He turned himself into a pickle.	Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.
Oh, my God!	Not an issue, sweetie.
I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.	Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
I, I liked her.	I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!
Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!	The point is he thought I was going to.
Who? Who was that, Rick?	You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.
Then why aren't we killing them?!	Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.
Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!	Oldest Rick trick in the book.
Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!	Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep.	Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.
Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!	Destroying the  galactic government.
Rick!	Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.
Rick, stop!	Guess who dismantled the government?
Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!	I never will, baby.
Happy hour.	Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.
Whoa, yeah!	No, you're right. Where's the vodka?
Did he say "three for three"?	Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.
You mean "two for two", right, Vance?	What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.
So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?	Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.
We weren't here "last time", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...	For everybody.
This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts".	Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.
I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.	Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.
Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?	He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.
Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.	I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -
Yeah, but not heroes.	- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -
I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine!	- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -
Oh, God.	- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -
I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.	- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that "Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -
I-I-I... I'm not a superhero.	- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.
Rick says "good" and "bad" are artificial constructs.	That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.
Get it yourself.	I want that "Mulan" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.
Just focus on the mission, all right?	If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.
Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!	That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.
Rick, is-is this a "Saw" thing? Are you seriously "Saw"-ing the Vindicators?	Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.
Vance, stay calm...	For 97 more years, Morty!
Okay, ouch, but...	I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!
Guys!  I've figured it out.	Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.
It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.	Absolutely.
The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!	Yeah, either one. Either one.
That's not the issue, Rick!	You'll never get away with this, Concerto.
Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?	This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.
W-Wait, huh?	Jaguar!
Oh, o-okay. This again?	That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.
I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.	Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.
In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!	Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?
You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.	I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!
Too many, Rick! Too many!	They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.
You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?	God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.
Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...	Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.
Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.	My balls.
Holy shit. You're jealous.	Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.
Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!	Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...
I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.	Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.
What?	So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?
I'll cover that bet. I get it.	Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.
...Motherfucker!	Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!
Shut up.	Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.
Greater good?!	Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.
Never said that!	Did he say he never forgets a kid?
No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?	I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.
Right?	I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.
Rick, Supernova's getting away!	Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.
But.. she was trying to kill us!	Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.
Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.	Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?
Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!	Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?
They tried to murder him first.	Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.
Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.	Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...
Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.	Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.
Man. Glad I’m not one of them!	Ugh! Oh, Christ...
Mortys are human!	Barely.
WHOA!!	Uh-huh.
That was amazing!	Uh, my God, that's better.
I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?	Hey, I can't help if I can't see.
Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!	Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!
